Build a real life quiz 
covered most scenarios to reduce bugs as much as possible
applied clean code simple to understand, even a normal persona without coding background can read my functions names and understand what i am trying to do
reduced duplications as much as possible using abstraction where possible without limiting access to elements in the future. encapsulated operations into functions where possible to reduce 
used polymorphism concept where suitable
found the shortest easiest ways to build the logic without lengthy functions or adding extra unnecessary code, variables or functions e.g I used .sort(); to choose random questions every time the quiz runs and also to sort the scores descendingly to show highest scores first.
